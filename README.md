The ElectraPay repositories have been moved in private location. This change is due to the near completion of development, and the use that the Electra project has planned for ElectraPay.

To avoid any risk of theft and misappropriation of our flagship product, the entire team voted for a private view with limited access to developers.

    An article will soon be published to explain to everyone this strategic and vital change for the team, but especially for all Electra holders.
