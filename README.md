The ElectraPay repositories have been moved in private location. This change is due to the near completion of development, and the use that the Electra project has planned for ElectraPay.

To avoid any risk of theft and misappropriation of our flagship product, the entire team voted for a private view with limited access to developers.

    An article will soon be published to explain to everyone this strategic and vital change for the team, but especially for all Electra holders.

# Update 06-19-2020

Refactoring of the ElectraPay frontend is in progress to fix the current bugs (UI) and new features will be integrated to improve the user experience.

New coins integration have been tested and successful.

A point-of-sale solution is currently being developed to extend the reach of the ElectraPay environment. A prototype is already developed and fully working.

ElectraPay brings a specific feature already used by our partner "Les huitres Alain Courdavault" and will be an important asset for the ElectraPay environment. We will inform you in due time on this point.

*Many other points are currently in progress, but we cannot disclose them at this time.*
